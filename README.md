In this Responsive Web Design repsitory, I have included the small web apps that I have learn during my course in [#FreecodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design). I have learn languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 12, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: HTML tags give a webpage its structure.Build a cat Photo App which gives an introduction to the basic HTML tags.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with web designing.Although I have some basic knowledge on HTML, I am getting stuck in the middle of my projects.I thought to brush up my web designing skill from A to Z through this certification.
