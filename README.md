In this Responsive Web Design repsitory, I have included the small web apps that I have learn during my course in [#FreecodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design). I have learn languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.
